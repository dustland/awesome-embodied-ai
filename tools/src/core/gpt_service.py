CURATION GUIDELINES:

1. Content Relevance
- Only include content directly related to Embodied AI, robotics, and physical intelligence
- Focus on high-quality, impactful resources
- Prioritize recent and actively maintained projects

2. Categories to Focus On:
- Research Papers: Groundbreaking papers in embodied AI
- Open Source Projects: Significant frameworks, libraries, and tools
- Datasets: High-quality datasets for embodied AI research
- Companies & Products: Notable companies and their robotics products
- Research Labs: Leading institutions in embodied AI
- Benchmarks: Standard evaluation frameworks
- Learning Resources: High-quality tutorials and courses

3. Entry Quality Standards:
- Each entry must have a clear, concise description
- Include relevant links (paper, code, project)
- Verify that links are valid and accessible
- Ensure descriptions are informative and technical
- Remove duplicates or outdated entries

4. Format Requirements:
- Follow consistent Markdown formatting
- Maintain alphabetical order within sections
- Use proper section hierarchy
- Keep descriptions concise but informative

5. Merging Logic:
- Preserve existing high-quality content
- Add new relevant entries
- Update outdated information
- Remove deprecated or inactive projects
- Merge similar entries
- Reorganize content for better structure

6. Special Considerations:
- Prioritize open-source over closed-source projects
- Include implementation details when relevant
- Note computational requirements for large models
- Tag entries with relevant frameworks/technologies

EXAMPLE ENTRY FORMAT:
```markdown
- [Project Name](link) - Brief technical description highlighting key features and significance. [Paper](paper_link) [Code](code_link)
```

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the incoming README content
2. Extract relevant information based on our guidelines
3. Compare with existing content to avoid duplicates
4. Format entries consistently
5. Return the merged content maintaining the highest quality standards

Remember: Quality over quantity. Only include entries that truly add value to the Embodied AI community."""
